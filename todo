Backend:
 - detect end of game
 - add irreversibility => maybe add a flag "irreversibilityCheck" for automatic action to disable auto entering this state (even if it's the only one pending) and give the user a chance to confirm first
 - end implementation of cards

 Barbaras Cave soit le seul qui dise "jusqu'à 3 savoirs" -> appliquer la suggestion de Iello On vous propose donc la formulation suivante : "Choisissez 1 monument dans la Frise d’un de vos adversaires, et placez-y 3 [savoir perdu] de votre plateau.". 

Frontend:
 - mediumMessage notification: nothing to code, but just add a timeout of 1s (or 1.2s) so that players have the time to read the notif in the top bar

 - scoreboard
 - endOfGameTriggered notif => can be tested using "triggerEnd()" function in chat
  => boolean in getAllDatas to display banner near page title (endOfGameTriggered field)

 - error : During notification declineCard
  tooltipToMap[1] is undefined
  AncientKnowledge.prototype.addLogClass@https://studio.boardgamearena.com:8084/data/themereleases


 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh
 - undo : multiple trigger when clicking on one "undo here"

 - increase timing of notifications so we can read the title page and process it before moving on the next one (lot of them are chaining at the end of a turn)
  => maybe a slider to choose speed of notifs ?

 - past cards : see how to display straight cards mixed with rotated cards
