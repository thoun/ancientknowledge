Backend:
 - add irreversibility => maybe add a flag "irreversibilityCheck" for automatic action to disable auto entering this state (even if it's the only one pending) and give the user a chance to confirm first
 - end implementation of cards

 Barbaras Cave soit le seul qui dise "jusqu'à 3 savoirs" -> appliquer la suggestion de Iello On vous propose donc la formulation suivante : "Choisissez 1 monument dans la Frise d’un de vos adversaires, et placez-y 3 [savoir perdu] de votre plateau.". 

 - bugged cards : "Diquis Stone Spheres
planetary stone, tzolkin (artefacts), rongorongo glyph (connaissance)
ancient hebrew"

Frontend:
 - flipTechTile action :
   => propose tile 1 and tile 2 with buttons => send 1 or 2 to backend + dont forget to ask for confirmation since it's an irreversible action
   => new field in getAllDatas : secondLvl2TechTile is either 0 if irrelevant, or otherwise give you the board number that should have lvlII techs as well
   => updated midGameReached notification to send you the board number as well
   
 - error : During notification declineCard
  tooltipToMap[1] is undefined

 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh
 - undo : multiple trigger when clicking on one "undo here"

 - increase timing of notifications so we can read the title page and process it before moving on the next one (lot of them are chaining at the end of a turn)
  => maybe a slider to choose speed of notifs ?

 - past cards : see how to display straight cards mixed with rotated cards 

 - todo make it clearer when selecting tokens : is it how many selected or how many remaining ?
 - test text auto-sizing on all cards
