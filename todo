TO TEST :
  * Barabar Caves and other addKnowledge
  * PYRAMID OF USERKAF and other discard Multi
  * P15_XixiaWangling
  * A32_ElongatedSkulls


Backend:
 - add irreversibility => maybe add a flag "irreversibilityCheck" for automatic action to disable auto entering this state (even if it's the only one pending) and give the user a chance to confirm first
 - end implementation of cards

 Barbaras Cave soit le seul qui dise "jusqu'à 3 savoirs" -> appliquer la suggestion de Iello On vous propose donc la formulation suivante : "Choisissez 1 monument dans la Frise d’un de vos adversaires, et placez-y 3 [savoir perdu] de votre plateau.". 

 - bugged cards : "tzolkin (artefacts), rongorongo glyph (connaissance)
ancient hebrew"

 - improve discard multi: awake only players that have choices + bypass action if no other players can discard

Frontend:
 - discardMulti action: maybe wont change much, but cardIds can also be artefact for P8_PYRAMID OF USERKAF

 - addKnowledge action :
   => cardIds : for each pId, list of card ids in their timeline
   => takeAtomicAction(actAddKnowledge, choices) where choices is of the form { pId1: cardId1, pId2: cardId2, ...}
   => dont put anything for pId with empty timeline
   => autoselect opponents card for opponent with exactly 1 card in their timeline
   => Notif addKnowledge : very similar to removeKnowledge
  - addKnowledgeFromBoard action: just for Barabar Caves, knowledge comes from lost knowledge instead of reserve + select a single card
   => same args
   => takeAtomicAction(actAddKnowledgeFromBoard, cardId), just the single card selected
   => Notif addKnowledgeFromBoard : card instead of cards + need to use player_id to remove knowledge from them instead of taking them from the reserve

 - flipTechTile action :
   => propose tile 1 and tile 2 with buttons => send 1 or 2 to backend + dont forget to ask for confirmation since it's an irreversible action
   => new field in getAllDatas : secondLvl2TechTile is either 0 if irrelevant, or otherwise give you the board number that should have lvlII techs as well
   => updated midGameReached notification to send you the board number as well
   
 - error : During notification declineCard
  tooltipToMap[1] is undefined
  AncientKnowledge.prototype.addLogClass@https://studio.boardgamearena.com:8084/data/themereleases


 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh
 - undo : multiple trigger when clicking on one "undo here"

 - increase timing of notifications so we can read the title page and process it before moving on the next one (lot of them are chaining at the end of a turn)
  => maybe a slider to choose speed of notifs ?

 - past cards : see how to display straight cards mixed with rotated cards 

 - todo make it clearer when selecting tokens : is it how many selected or how many remaining ?
 - test text auto-sizing on all cards
