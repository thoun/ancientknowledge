Backend:
 - detect end of game
 - add irreversibility => maybe add a flag "irreversibilityCheck" for automatic action to disable auto entering this state (even if it's the only one pending) and give the user a chance to confirm first
 - end implementation of cards
 - T16_SatorSquare : asks to swap, with no card on timeline
 - add a log like "{player_name} Timeline phase is skipped (no Timeline phase effect)" ?

Frontend:
 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - resolve choices : grayed out button contains only the source, not the description of what could have been granted if requirements were met

 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh
 - undo : multiple trigger when clicking on one "undo here"

 - increase timing of notifications so we can read the title page and process it before moving on the next one (lot of them are chaining at the end of a turn)
  => maybe a slider to choose speed of notifs ?

 - automatically add tooltips with zoomed card on every 'card_name' going through format_string_recursive

 - remove knowledge : 
   - a "select all knowledge on this card" button on each card ?
   - player can always choose to not remove all of them : "discard up to X..."

 - knowledge on card : too hard to see => either add a white contour or (better IMO) put a counter instead inside a white (opacity 0.8 or sthg) rounded square with 1/3 the size of the background image in the top right corner
  -> them problem with a counter is how do they select the knowledge to remove? let's try with a white countour

 - past cards : see how to display straight cards mixed with rotated cards 

To check with Quentin :
- Is it useful to show counters for tech deck & discard with counter ?
- Same question for Builder cards deck/discard
