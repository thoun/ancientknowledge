TO TEST :
  * Barabar Caves and other addKnowledge M24_TlalocsStatue   M15_BarabarCaves
  * PYRAMID OF USERKAF and other discard Multi
  * A32_ElongatedSkulls


Backend:
 - add irreversibility => maybe add a flag "irreversibilityCheck" for automatic action to disable auto entering this state (even if it's the only one pending) and give the user a chance to confirm first
 - end implementation of cards

 - improve discard multi: awake only players that have choices + bypass action if no other players can discard

Frontend:
 - discardMulti action: maybe wont change much, but cardIds can also be artefact for P8_PYRAMID OF USERKAF

 - error : During notification declineCard
  tooltipToMap[1] is undefined
  AncientKnowledge.prototype.addLogClass@https://studio.boardgamearena.com:8084/data/themereleases


 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh
 - undo : multiple trigger when clicking on one "undo here"

 - increase timing of notifications so we can read the title page and process it before moving on the next one (lot of them are chaining at the end of a turn)
  => maybe a slider to choose speed of notifs ?

 - past cards : see how to display straight cards mixed with rotated cards 

 - todo make it clearer when selecting tokens : is it how many selected or how many remaining ?
 - test text auto-sizing on all cards
