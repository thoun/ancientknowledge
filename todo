Backend:
 - refill tech tiles
 - detect mid game
 - detect end of game
 - add irreversibility

Frontend:
 - error on declineSlideLeft notif : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "past" : slot "past" doesn't exists.
 - error : Uncaught (in promise) Error: Impossible to add card to slot "timeline-0-0" : slot "timeline-0-0" doesn't exists.
 
 - resolve choices : grayed out button contains only the source, not the description of what could have been granted if requirements were met

 - Learn :
   - irreversibleIds => askConfirmation
   - clearTechBoard notif
   - fillingUpTechBoard notif
   - display deck / discard of level 1/2 tech tiles with number of cards left in deck ?

 - player board : display number of cards in the past

 - Swap action : can be tried with 'P23_PyramidsOfXian'
    - receive cardIds in timeline
    - card_id is either null if player can swap any two cards, or is the id of a card he must swap with another one (preselect this one)
    - actSwap(cardId1, cardId2) => cardId1 should always be the one of the "forced" card if any
    - notification

 - update "undo turn" on the log depending on the args => dont work after irreversible step where the old "undo here" are still here.
    => works when you refresh

 - destroy action: notif destroyCard => similar to discardCards but always from the timeline and always a SINGLE card
 - straighten action: notif straightenCard => set rotated back to 0
    => I changed something here : cards now have an extra field "rotated" that is either 0 or 1 instead of relying on state
    that way cards in the past can be ordered by entry date (or anything else) without messing with rotated status
